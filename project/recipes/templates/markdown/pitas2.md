## Tips

This recipe makes 6 medium-size pitas.
The pita dough can go directly on a sheet pan, but make sure the pitas have been lightly covered in flour to prevent sticking to the sheet pan.
The oven should be very hot (425-450 degree F) to cause air to fill within the pita to create the amazing pocket.

## Ingredients

* 250 grams of Bread Flour, plus more for the rolling out the dough 
* 7 grams (1 packet) of Dried Active Yeast
* 5 grams of Salt
* 160mL Water (between 100-100 degrees (Fahrenheit))
* 1 Tablespoon of Extra-Virgin Olive Oil

## Steps

1. In a mixing bowl, measure in the yeast and add the warm water. Mix with a whisk to incorporate the ingredients.
2. Wait for 5-10 minutes for the yeast to bloom (it should look bubbly in the water).
3. Add the flour and the salt to the yeast mixture and mix in a stand mixer for 6 minutes.
4. Add the olive oil to a medium-size bowl and then use a spatula to add the dough from the mixing bowl into the olive oil.  Move the dough around in the olive oil to help coat the dough, which prevents the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl while it rises.
5. Let the dough rise (double in size) for 1 to 1.5 hours in a warm spot, such as in an oven that is off.
6. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees (F), preferably on convection bake.
7. Prepare a clean surface (such as a large cutting board) by covering it with the extra flour.
8. Pull apart a golf-ball size piece of dough and roll it out flat on the work surface.  The dough should be about as thick as a coin and in a circle shape.
9. Roll out 3 pitas on a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes.  The tops of the pitas should have a slight brown color to them.
10. Repeat with the remaining pita dough, which will be about 3 additional pitas.
11. Let the pitas cool for about 10 minutes before enjoying!
