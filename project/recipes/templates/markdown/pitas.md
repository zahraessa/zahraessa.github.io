## Title

Pitas (No Yeast)

## Description

This pita recipe is fast enough to make during the week, as it does not use yeast!  Baking powder is the key ingredient to make light, fluffy pitas.

These pitas go amazingly with grilled chicken/vegetables and hummus!

## Tips

Let the dough rest for 15 minutes before shaping into pitas. I've found that waiting less time causes the pitas to not be very fluffy.
Make sure to thoroughly mix the baking powder into the dough so that it is evenly incorporated.
This recipe makes 6-8 small pitas.
If you are going to be making pitas, it's worth buying a <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/silpat-reg-silpain-reg-silicone-bread-baking-mat/1044058814">SilPain</a> as it REALLY makes a difference.

## Ingredients

* 300 grams of All-Purpose Flour
* 200 mL of Cold Water
* 2 Tablespoons of Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
* 1 Teaspoon of Salt
* 2 Teaspoons of Baking Powder

## Steps

1. Preheat the over to 400 degrees (Fahrenheit).
2. Combine half of the flour, water, oil, salt, and baking powder and mix thoroughly.
3. Add in the remaining flour and mix until all the dough pieces form together to make a dough ball.
4. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
5. Take out individual balls of dough (recipe should make 6-8 pitas) onto a surface generously covered in flour (the dough is quite sticky at this point).
6. Roll out the pitas using a rolling pin into circle shapes (about 4 inches in diameter).
7. Place each pita on a baking sheet (preferably with a <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/silpat-reg-silpain-reg-silicone-bread-baking-mat/1044058814">SilPain</a>); you'll need to do this in two patches.
8. Bake the pitas for 9 minutes (just before getting browned on top).
9. Let rest for 5 minutes and enjoy!
