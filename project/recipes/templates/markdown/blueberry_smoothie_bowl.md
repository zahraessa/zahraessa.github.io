Blueberry Smoothie Bowl

## Description

A blueberry smoothie bowl is one of my favorite breakfasts!  I love the mixture of banana and blueberries to create the base of the bowl.

This smoothie bowl can be topped with your favorite toppings, such as granola, fresh fruit, coconut flakes, flaxseeds, etc.

I find having a smoothie bowl like this for breakfast really helps to hydrate me for the day and gives me energy for the morning.

## Tips

I like to add as little almond milk (the liquid) as possible into the blender to make the smoothie thick.  Even with a high-speed blender, I find that I need to use a spatula to mix up the smoothie in the blender to help everything get combined.

Water can be used instead of almond milk, but I find that the almond milk helps with the taste and consistency.

## Ingredients

* 1 large banana
* 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries (I really like using wild blueberries, which are smaller than normal blueberries)
* 1/4 cup of almond milk
* Toppings: fresh fruit, granola, coconut flakes, flaxseeds, etc.

## Steps

1. Add the banana, frozen blueberries, and almond milk to a blender.
2. Blend until well combined and the frozen blueberries are completely mixed into the smoothie mixture.  I find I need to stop the blender, use a spatula to mix up the smoothie, and then blend some more.
3. Scoop smoothie mixture into a bowl and add your favorite toppings.  Enjoy!
