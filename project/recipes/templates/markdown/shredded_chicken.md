Shredded Chicken

## Description

Shredded chicken is the base for so many of my favorite recipes!
Shredded chicken is the key ingredient in [taquitos](/dinner/taquitos/)
I like to make a big batch of the taco seasoning as it keeps for a few months in an air-tight container.

## Tips

Shredding the chicken is best done on a cutting board using a serrated knife (like a small bread knife) with a fork.
After the chicken is shredded, let it sit in the salsa sauce to absorb the delicious salsa/taco seasoning mixture.  This step also makes the chicken come out really moist.

## Ingredients

#### Taco Seasoning:

* 6 teaspoons of Chili Powder
* 4 teaspoons of Ground Cumin
* 4 teaspoons of Oregano (Dried)
* 4 teaspoons of Cocoa Powder
* 2 teaspoons of Onion Powder
* 2 teaspoons of Black Pepper
* 0.5 teaspoons of Ground Coriander

#### Other ingredients:

* 1.5 pounds of Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast
* 1 jar of Salsa

## Steps

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, add just enough water to cover the bottom (this helps prevent the chicken from sticking).
2. Add the chicken breasts, cover with 2 tablespoons of the taco seasoning, and pour the jarred salsa over the chicken.
3. Cover the pot and cook on medium heat for 20 minutes.
4. Turn over the chicken and cook for 20 more minutes (covered).
5. With the chicken fully cooked, take out 1 chicken breast at a time and cut/shred the chicken on a cutting board.  Add all the cut chicken pieces back into the pot to mix with the sauce.
6. After all the chicken is shredded, mix the chicken thoroughly into the salsa sauce, turn off the heat, and cover the pot.
7. Let sit for 5 minutes to have the chicken absorb the salsa sauce and serve while hot!
