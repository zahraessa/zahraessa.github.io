## Title

Taquitos

## Description

Taquitos are rolled tacos that are usually deep-fried, but they come out amazing in an air fryer!
The outside of the taquitos (corn tortilla) gets really crunchy in the air fryer, but the inside (chicken and cheese) is flavorful and creamy.

## Tips

Use toothpicks (plain wood) to hold the rolled tacos in place while cooking in the air fryer; otherwise, the tortillas unroll while cooking.
I've found that the filling in the rolled tacos should not be too much, as the filling can easily spill out in the air fryer if too full.
When rolling the tacos, pull the tortilla tightly.  This approach makes for a tight taco that cooks perfectly.
A [tortilla warmer ](https://www.target.com/p/imusa-8-5-plastic-tortilla-arepa-warmer/-/A-50860234#lnk=sametab) is great for keeping corn tortillas warm, but it also makes them more pliable for rolling.

## Ingredients

* [Shredded Chicken](/dinner/shredded_chicken/)
* Sharp Cheddar Cheese (sliced into small, thin pieces)
* Corn Tortillas (Recommendation: [White Corn Tortillas - Mission](https://www.missionfoods.com/products/white-corn-tortillas/))

## Steps

1. Get all the ingredients (shredded chicken, corn tortillas, and sliced cheddar cheese) prepared ([Mise en place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)!)
2. In a frying pan, heat up the corn tortillas and place each into the tortilla warmer.
3. After heating up all the tortillas, place one corn tortilla on a cutting board, place a small amount of shredded chicken (2 small spoonfuls) in the center of the tortilla and top with two thin slices of cheddar cheese.
4. Tightly roll the tortilla and use two toothpicks to hold the rolled tortilla together.
5. Repeat to make more taquitos (that can fit into the air fryer.)
6. Cook the taquitos for 10 minutes at 350 degrees (F) in the air fryer.
7. Serve with your favorite sides (guacamole, salsa, shredded lettuce)!
