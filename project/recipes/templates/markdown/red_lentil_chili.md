Red Lentil Chili

## Description

Red Lentil Chili is a vegan chili that is absolutely delicious and such a comforting meal!

I enjoy eating Red Lentil Chili over [Jasmine Rice](/side_dishes/jasmine_rice/) and adding peas or corn as a topping.

This recipe is inspired by the excellent [Red Lentil Chili recipe](https://highcarbhannah.co/recipes/red-lentil-chili/) from [High Carb Hannah](https://highcarbhannah.co/); I highly recommend checking out her YouTube videos for excellent recipe ideas and vegan-eating inspiration!

## Tips

I've made this recipe without the red bell pepper (by accident!) and the red bell pepper really adds a nice sweetness to the dish.

The red lentils need to cook for at least 20 minutes, but I like to cook the dish for 30 minutes to really have the flavors mix together.

## Ingredients

* 1 large Red Onion
* 1 large Red Bell Pepper
* 1 cup of Red Lentils
* 2 cans (15oz) of Fire-Roasted Diced Tomatoes (Recommendation: [Fire-Roasted Diced Tomatoes from Thrive Market](https://thrivemarket.com/p/thrive-market-organic-fire-roasted-tomatoes))
* 2 cups of Water
* 1 Tablespoon of Chili Powder
* 1 Tablespoon of Smoked Paprika
* 2 Tablespoons of Better Than Bouillon (Recommendation: [Better Than Bouillon (Organic Vegetable Base) from Thrive Market](https://thrivemarket.com/p/better-than-bouillon-organic-vegetable-base-bouillon))

## Steps

1. Finely dice up the onion and the red bell pepper into small pieces, so they are easy to sauté.
2. Add the onions to a large, heavy-bottomed pan or Ditch oven with 2 Tablespoons of water and sauté for 5 minutes on medium heat.
3. Add the diced bell pepper to the pot and sauté for an additional 3 minutes.
4. Add all the remaining ingredients into the pot and mix well.
5. Cover the pot and let simmer on medium-low heat for 30 minutes (to fully cook the red lentils).
6. Serve over Jasmine Rice!
