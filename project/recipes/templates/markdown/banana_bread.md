Banana Bread

## Description

This banana bread recipe is gluten-free, nutritious, and delicious!

This banana bread uses almond flour and gluten-free oat flour, which gives a great texture, but don't expect the bread to rise very much (it's a shallow bread).

I enjoy eating this banana bread with breakfast or as an afternoon snack!

## Tips

I don't keep oat flour in my pantry, so I used gluten-free rolled oats and grind them up in a high-speed blender for about a minute to make oat flour.

This banana bread needs to sit for at least 20 minutes before cutting/eating, as it comes out of the oven too hot to cut.

Using parchment paper in the bread pan makes taking the banana bread out of the pan very easy.

## Ingredients

* 2 ripe bananas
* 1 tablespoon of maple syrup (or agave nectar)
* 3/4 cup of oat flour
* 6 tablespoons of almond flour (recommendation: [Bob's Red Mill - Almond Flout](https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html]))
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (ground)
* 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
2. Cut parchment paper to fit into a small bread loaf pan (approximately 8" x 5" loaf pan).
3. In a medium mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork or a potato masher until smooth.
4. Add the maple syrup to the bowl and mix to combine (with a wooden spoon).
5. Add the dry ingredients (oat flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt) to the bowl and mix to combine.
6. Pour the batter into the loaf pan (with the parchment paper already in the pan) and spread out to an even layer (it will be a thin bread).
7. Bake for 60 minutes.
8. Let the bread rest for at least 20 minutes before cutting. Enjoy!
