<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A blueberry smoothie bowl is one of my favorite breakfasts!  I love the mixture of banana and blueberries to create the base of the bowl.</p>
<p>This smoothie bowl can be topped with your favorite toppings, such as granola, fresh fruit, coconut flakes, flaxseeds, etc.</p>
<p>I find having a smoothie bowl like this for breakfast really helps to hydrate me for the day and gives me energy for the morning.</p>

{% block recipe_tips %}
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>I like to add as little almond milk (the liquid) as possible into the blender to make the smoothie thick.  Even with a high-speed blender, I find that I need to use a spatula to mix up the smoothie in the blender to help everything get combined.</p>
<p>Water can be used instead of almond milk, but I find that the almond milk helps with the taste and consistency.</p>

<h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add the banana, frozen blueberries, and almond milk to a blender.</li>
<li>Blend until well combined and the frozen blueberries are completely mixed into the smoothie mixture.  I find I need to stop the blender, use a spatula to mix up the smoothie, and then blend some more.</li>
<li>Scoop smoothie mixture into a bowl and add your favorite toppings.  Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
