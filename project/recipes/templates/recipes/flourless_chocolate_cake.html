<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This delicious cake is an incredible dessert, plus it's gluten-free!  This cake is fudgy and chocolate-y, as it is similar in texture to a brownie.</p>
<p>The dusting of powdered sugar on the top of the cake is both decorative and adds a nice sweetness.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Be patient and take your time with the double-boiler when melting the chocolate and the butter.  The melting process should take 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Use a sift for adding the cocoa powder into the batter and also for dusting the cake at the end with powdered sugar.  The whisk really helps to break up any pieces and results in a smooth, uniform texture/finish.</p>
