<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spanish rice is a delicious combination of fluffy rice with a tomato finish.  It is one of my favorite dishes and it goes perfectly with fajitas.</p>
<p>I always thought that the delicious rice that you get at Mexican restaurants was going to be too difficult to make at home.  I was so excited to learn how to make this recipe at home and I make it now at least once a week.</p>

<h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 Tablespoons of Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>2 Cups of Long-Grain Rice</li>
<li>4 Tablespoons of Tomato Paste</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
<li>1/4 Teaspoon of Ground Cumin</li>

<li>1/2 Teaspoon of Onion Powder</li>
<li>3.5 Cups of Chicken Broth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a dutch oven, pour in the olive oil to cover the bottom of the dutch oven.</li>
<li>Heat the dutch oven (with the oil in it) on medium heat for 3 minutes</li>
<li>In a small bowl or a large measuring cup, mix together the tomato paste, salt, ground cumin, tumeric, onion powder, and chicken broth with a whisk (to fully mix the tomato paste into the chicken broth)</li>
<li>Add the rice to the dutch oven and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from burn on the bottom of the dutch oven</li>
<li>Add the spice mixture to the dutch oven; stir to combine with the rice</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to medium-low</li>
<li>Cover the dutch over and cook for 20 minutes</li>
<li>After 20 minutes, take the cover off of the dutch oven and mix the rice</li>
<li>Cook the rice for an additional 15 minutes</li>
<li>To check if the rice is done, take the cover off of the dutch oven and fluff the rice.  All of the liquid should be absorbed into the rice and the rice should taste soft and fluffy.</li>
<li>If the rice is not done, cook for longer at 5 minute increments</li>
<li>Once the rice is done cooking, fluff the rice one last time and turn off the heat</li>
<li>The rice can be served immediately, but I've found it best to let it continue to cook slightly in the dutch over (with the heat off or away from the stove) for an additional 10 minutes</li>
</ol>
